organizations like yours, and we are very competitive in our pricing, $3,500 a month,\\n', '00:45.000 --> 00:52.000\\n and we also provide a project engineer who has the whole thing in case and continuous contact,\\n', '00:52.000 --> 00:56.000\\n and we can actually start within 48 hours.\\n', \"00:56.000 --> 01:00.000\\n So, just wondering if you'd like to see a few resumes?\\n\", '01:00.000 --> 01:01.000\\n I got it.\\n', \"01:01.000 --> 01:07.000\\n No, the reason I was wondering is that we're already in the final interview phase.\\n\", \"01:07.000 --> 01:10.000\\n We have a five different panels that we've been speaking to.\\n\", \"01:10.000 --> 01:16.000\\n That's where we're already made a hot push for one.\\n\", '01:16.000 --> 01:19.000\\n Okay, I understand.\\n', '01:19.000 --> 01:20.000\\n I understand.\\n', \"01:20.000 --> 01:22.000\\n Just letting you know, though, things don't work out.\\n\", \"01:22.000 --> 01:29.000\\n I mean, our fees of $3,500 a month, you absolutely can't beat that for the quality of engineers that we provide,\\n\", '01:29.000 --> 01:38.000\\n and you are basically we keep you updated and posted 24-7 as far as how everything is going,\\n', \"01:38.000 --> 01:44.000\\n and any time you need any kind of information, you can get in touch with us and you'll have it just like that.\\n\", \"01:44.000 --> 01:48.000\\n So, it's definitely worth looking at in the future.\\n\", '01:48.000 --> 01:49.000\\n Okay?\\n', \"01:49.000 --> 01:51.000\\n Yeah, no, okay, no, that's perfect.\\n\", '01:51.000 --> 01:53.000\\n Hey, I know I appreciate you reaching out.\\n', '01:53.000 --> 01:55.000\\n I have someone already reach out.\\n', '01:55.000 --> 01:57.000\\n The name sounds really familiar.\\n', '01:57.000 --> 01:59.000\\n I think he emailed me.\\n', '01:59.000 --> 02:05.000\\n Oh, okay, so someone already contacted you from Aloha Technology then?\\n', '02:05.000 --> 02:07.000\\n Yes, the name is very familiar, yeah.\\n', '02:07.000 --> 02:08.000\\n Okay.\\n', '02:08.000 --> 02:11.000\\n So, I think so.\\n', \"02:11.000 --> 02:18.000\\n What would help me is, I mean, just as far as that goes, once we're in the hiring phase again,\\n\", \"02:18.000 --> 02:22.000\\n but it looks like we're basically going to make a decision this week on the second position,\\n\", '02:22.000 --> 02:26.000\\n and then we have the people that we currently need staffing-wise for front-end.\\n', \"02:26.000 --> 02:29.000\\n We'll be looking for backing engineers in the future.\\n\", '02:29.000 --> 02:31.000\\n Yeah, we have those too.\\n', '02:31.000 --> 02:33.000\\n Right, I know, I bet.\\n', '02:33.000 --> 02:34.000\\n That makes sense.\\n', \"02:34.000 --> 02:37.000\\n So, and I've had a couple different green agents reach out to me as well,\\n\", \"02:37.000 --> 02:45.000\\n and typically they do like a fee-based thing where once they're hired, then, okay, we've got a placement.\\n\", \"02:45.000 --> 02:49.000\\n So, like for the volume of people we're hiring, we're not looking at like, you know,\\n\", \"02:49.000 --> 02:52.000\\n we wouldn't really need them month to month kind of situations\\n\", \"02:52.000 --> 02:55.000\\n if we're only hiring maybe once a year or something like that.\\n\", '02:55.000 --> 03:01.000\\n So, as far as that goes, I mean, if you want to send me information, feel free.\\n', '03:01.000 --> 03:02.000\\n Sure.\\n', '03:02.000 --> 03:04.000\\n I would be fine with seeing that.\\n', '03:04.000 --> 03:06.000\\n I think I have someone else.\\n', '03:06.000 --> 03:07.000\\n I can check real quick here.\\n', '03:07.000 --> 03:10.000\\n Yeah, so you already had someone send you some information then?\\n', \"03:10.000 --> 03:17.000\\n Yeah, let's see.\\n\", '03:17.000 --> 03:18.000\\n The name sounds familiar.\\n', \"03:18.000 --> 03:21.000\\n I may have gotten a call or I don't see an email here,\\n\", \"03:21.000 --> 03:26.000\\n but if you want to send me an email with information, I'd be happy to look at it.\\n\", '03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\\n Sure.\\n', '03:27.000 --> 03:28.000\\n Of course, I would love to do that.\\n', '03:28.000 --> 03:30.000\\n What is your email address?\\n', \"03:30.000 --> 03:33.000\\n So, it's A.mylastname, which is A.B.\\n\", '03:33.000 --> 03:42.000\\n B, U, C as in cat, E as in zebra, Y as in Nancy, S-K-Y, at, and then Kyoto

'02:10.640 --> 02:11.280\\n Right, right.\\n', '02:11.280 --> 02:13.040\\n So all of that stuff is within that wheelhouse.\\n', \"02:13.040 --> 02:16.000\\n Yeah, that wouldn't be a priority for us

So, that's definitely something that we do, whether it's, you know, contract or full-time.\\n\", '02:12.000 --> 02:18.000\\n I understand all of our engineers are on average anywhere between five to seven years experience.\\n', '02:18.000 --> 02:24.000\\n Would that be staff organization or do you have people on your staff?\\n', '02:24.000 --> 02:27.000\\n Is it staff organization or do you have

'02:33.000 --> 02:36.000\\n It comes with a project manager as well.\\n', '02:36.000 --> 02:39.000\\n We do our first 30 days on no commitment, you know,\\n', '02:39.000 --> 02:43.000\\n to take

team.\\n', '03:09.000 --> 03:15.000\\n The reason I ask is because I have my own practice, right?\\n', '03:15.000 --> 03:16.000\\n Okay.\\n', \"03:16.000 --> 03:25.000\\n I'm partners with American

\"03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\\n because I'm already on a contract with American Eagle.\\n\", '03:43.000 --> 03:45.000\\n Okay.\\n', \"03:45.000 --> 03:49.000\\n But otherwise, for other work too, it doesn't have to be specific to American Eagle.\\n\", '03:49.000 --> 03:54.000\\n But we do have people in India particularly,\\n', \"03:54.000 --> 03:58.000\\n but I'm always open to working with other people.\\n\", \"03:58.000 --> 04:00.000\\n So, I'm not a big fan of working with other people.\\n\", \"04:00.000 --> 04:02.000\\n I'm not a big fan of working with other people.\\n\",

that they have.\\n\", '04:10.000 --> 04:11.000\\n Understood.\\n', '04:11.000 --> 04:13.000\\n So, that could be kind of like the grandfather way that that would work.\\n', '04:13.000 --> 04:14.000\\n Okay.\\n', '04:14.000 --> 04:16.000\\n I think what would probably make sense to be honest, Jason,\\n', '04:16.000 --> 04:19.000\\n would it be possible?\\n', \"04:19.000 --> 04:22.000\\n Because I

about this.\\n', '04:26.000 --> 04:28.000\\n I think it would be a good idea to have a partnership aspect,\\n', \"04:28.000 --> 04:30.000\\n because that's what this sounds like.\\n\", '04:30.000 --> 04:32.000\\n I think that this could be very fruitful,\\n', '04:32.000 --> 04:36.000\\n because the majority of our staff is based out of, you know,\\n', \"04:36.000 --> 04:37.000\\n we're

a thousand different engineers that we offer, those guys are going\\n', '01:05.320 --> 01:08.440\\n to be based remote.\\n', '01:08.440 --> 01:10.040\\n We work really transparently.\\n', \"01:10.040 --> 01:13.960\\n Each of our engineers, they're $3,500 a month.\\n\", '01:13.960 --> 01:18.880\\n It comes with a project manager and we actually give our first month of that engineer that\\n', '01:18.880 --> 01:21.880\\n tandem actually no commitment, no cost.\\n', \"01:21.880 --> 01:25.080\\n We just look to provide the value that you're looking for.\\n\", \"01:25.080 --> 01:29.240\\n So what I'd like to do is coordinate a conversation.\\n\", '01:29.240 --> 01:32.080\\n We could talk about that more in detail.\\n', \"01:32.080 --> 01:36.080\\n If you have specific needs of people that you're looking for, I can forward some resumes\\n\", '01:36.080 --> 01:40.880\\n or just some professional profiles to you that you can review and see if that makes\\n', '01:40.880 --> 01:42.680\\n sense.\\n', '01:42.680 --> 01:47.640\\n But I think if we were to talk about it, maybe have a conversation, a meeting about it, I\\n', '01:47.640 --> 01:51.600\\n can also forward some information to you via email that breaks down the specifics of our\\n', '01:51.600 --> 01:54.640\\n company, our entire wheelhouse, what we support.\\n', '01:54.640 --> 01:56.600\\n I think that would be helpful too.\\n', '01:56.600 --> 01:57.920\\n Sure.\\n', '01:57.920 --> 02:08.080\\n If you could start with the email bit.\\n', '02:08.080 --> 02:10.280\\n Are we open to a remote team?\\n', '02:10.280 --> 02:11.280\\n Possibly.\\n', '02:11.280 --> 02:15.200\\n Our CTO is pretty resistant to that.\\n', '02:15.200 --> 02:16.200\\n Okay.\\n', \"02:16.200 --> 02:23.800\\n So what the first step would be, it's kind of some info on how you guys are structured.\\n\", \"02:23.800 --> 02:28.760\\n Like 3,500 months per person, hey, great, that's the home run.\\n\", \"02:28.760 --> 02:31.440\\n Compared to wages here, so that part's great.\\n\", \"02:31.440 --> 02:37.120\\n It's just functionally whether we think we can get value out of a remote team member\\n\", \"02:37.120 --> 02:38.440\\n and it'll work or not.\\n\", \"02:38.440 --> 02:40.440\\n That's really the issue.\\n\", '02:40.440 --> 02:41.440\\n Yeah.\\n', '02:41.440 --> 02:42.440\\n Yeah.\\n', \"02:42.440 --> 02:46.600\\n That was why I suggested, I mean, I'm going to forward to you an email that I have links\\n\", '02:46.600 --> 02:51.200\\n and some tangible information that you guys can review, especially with the CTO.\\n', \"02:51.200 --> 02:53.200\\n I think that's Andrew, correct?\\n\", '02:53.200 --> 02:54.200\\n Correct.\\n', '02:54.200 --> 02:55.200\\n Okay.\\n', \"02:55.200 --> 03:02.680\\n So I can definitely forward you that, but if we could, even if it's a quick 10, 15 minute,\\n\", \"03:02.680 --> 03:05.960\\n we can ask very specific questions because what I'm forwarding to you is just a really\\n\", '03:05.960 --> 03:06.960\\n broad-based...\\n', \"03:06.960 --> 03:07.960\\n Sure, that's fine.\\n\", '03:07.960 --> 03:08.960\\n Okay.\\n', \"03:08.960 --> 03:09.960\\n It's a really broad-based thing.\\n\", \"03:09.960 --> 03:15.800\\n I'll reply to it and there's a meeting link in my email signature and then you can just\\n\", '03:15.800 --> 03:16.800\\n find a time.\\n', '03:16.800 --> 03:17.800\\n Okay.\\n', \"03:17.800 --> 03:18.800\\n Yeah, that's perfect.\\n\", '03:18.800 --> 03:19.800\\n Okay.\\n', '03:19.800 --> 03:20.800\\n Yeah.\\n', \"03:20.800 --> 03:25.000\\n And I guess if you can respond to it, I'll just pick a time and then we'll just go with\\n\", '03:25.000 --> 03:26.000\\n that.\\n', '03:26.000 --> 03:27.000\\n Yeah.\\n', '03:27.000 --> 03:30.960\\n I might not respond until later today or tomorrow, but I will.\\n', '03:30.960 --> 03:31.960\\n Okay.\\n', '03:31.960 --> 03:32.960\\n No worries.\\n', '03:32.960 --> 03:33.960\\n I appreciate that.\\n',

really ramping up here in the North American market.\\n\", \"02:17.840 --> 02:21.920\\n I'd love to, you know, my goal was really just to see if I can coordinate some time\\n\", '02:21.920 --> 02:27.240\\n with either yourself or whoever that, I guess that IT manager would be, just to have a conversation\\n', '02:27.240 --> 02:29.720\\n and see if it makes sense.\\n', \"02:29.720 --> 02:32.880\\n If you have some free time, I'd love to schedule that with you.\\n\", '02:32.880 --> 02:35.880\\n But again, I just wanted it to make sense for you guys, you know.\\n', '02:35.880 --> 02:36.880\\n Yeah.\\n', '02:36.880 --> 02:41.040\\n Let me mention you to my head of digital product.\\n', '02:41.040 --> 02:42.040\\n Okay.\\n', \"02:42.040 --> 02:43.520\\n Because that's where that

\"02:47.960 --> 02:52.520\\n If it's okay for me to just email you my information, maybe you can forward it to that gentleman.\\n\", '02:52.520 --> 02:53.520\\n Sure.\\n', \"02:53.520 --> 02:55.320\\n

I mean, kind of at the end of the day.\\n', '04:08.800 --> 04:09.800\\n Oh, sure. Sure.\\n', \"04:09.800 --> 04:19.800\\n But you kind of peak managers.

Yeah, I was going to mention, you know, if it made sense, I don't know how your schedule look if it may be better next week to coordinate a call.\\n\", \"04:33.800 --> 04:41.800\\n That might actually could be better. But I guess, yeah, if you want to follow up next week, I'm open for that. So you want to shoot me an email.\\n\", \"04:41.800 --> 04:45.800\\n OK. Set up a time to talk or something. That's fine.\\n\", '04:45.800 --> 04:49.800\\n OK. So or so would you rather set up a time to talk for next week now or?\\n', \"04:49.800 --> 05:00.800\\n Yeah. OK. Yeah, probably. OK. Just shoot me. Just I'll tell you what. I'm swamped right now. I'm trying to get 30 minutes. I got to get something out the door.\\n\", \"05:00.800 --> 05:10.800\\n So I'm just an email. So let's pick a date next week and then tomorrow we can pick a date and at a time and we can kind of chat. OK.\\n\", \"05:10.800 --> 05:21.800\\n So, yeah, what I can do is email tomorrow or Wednesday and we'll and then we'll set it up for next week. But I'm not able to set next week's schedule up right now.\\n\", '05:21.800 --> 05:30.800\\n No worries. I mean, I can shoot you an email with just some times that are open for us.

in here at Aloha Tech.\\n\", \"00:29.720 --> 00:32.720\\n I just wanted to reach out and introduce myself because I didn't want to assume that might\\n\", \"00:32.720 --> 00:36.320\\n have been

Correct.\\n', '00:47.360 --> 00:48.360\\n So we do staff.\\n', \"00:48.360 --> 00:51.360\\n Our entire staff is...we're based overseas.\\n\", \"00:51.360 --> 00:53.120\\n We're in Singapore.\\n\", '00:53.120 --> 01:00.640\\n So each of our reps are at least four to six years of experience really based around whatever\\n', \"01:00.640 --> 01:03.080\\n the wheelhouse is that's needed.\\n\", '01:03.080 --> 01:05.080\\n The position that was posted was via LinkedIn.\\n', '01:05.080 --> 01:09.120\\n It was for a senior software engineer for API, like a backend role.\\n', '01:09.120 --> 01:14.200\\n So this is, I think, relatively recent, like a day or so.\\n', '01:14.200 --> 01:17.680\\n So that was really the role I was reaching out for.\\n', '01:17.680 --> 01:18.680\\n Yeah.\\n', \"01:18.680 --> 01:24.800\\n So we're self-settled sideways with staffing folks just in terms of people taking other\\n\", '01:24.800 --> 01:26.840\\n jobs, COVID rolling through facilities.\\n', '01:26.840 --> 01:27.840\\n Yeah.\\n', \"01:27.840 --> 01:30.640\\n And so we're really focused on bringing tech in-house right now.\\n\", '01:30.640 --> 01:31.640\\n Okay.\\n', \"01:31.640 --> 01:36.160\\n So I'll let my digital guy know that you guys are based in Singapore and not India, which\\n\", '01:36.160 --> 01:37.160\\n may be a difference.\\n', \"01:37.160 --> 01:39.640\\n And so I'll let him know if he wants to go that route.\\n\", \"01:39.640 --> 01:44.240\\n But we got really burned last year and aren't ready to get burned again.\\n\", '01:44.240 --> 01:45.240\\n Yeah.\\n', '01:45.240 --> 01:46.240\\n I totally, totally understand.\\n', \"01:46.240 --> 01:47.960\\n I'll just fill my due diligence.\\n\", \"01:47.960 --> 01:49.280\\n And I'm based here in the States.\\n\", '01:49.280 --> 01:53.280\\n We do have an office here in the States as well in Houston.\\n', '01:53.280 --> 02:01.780\\n So our HQ is really overseas, but we have over a thousand engineers between both locations.\\n', '02:01.780 --> 02:05.040\\n So hopefully that should bring a little more consolation.\\n', \"02:05.040 --> 02:09.400\\n But I just wanted to be honest, we're headquartered.\\n\", '02:09.400 --> 02:11.360\\n But we just now started getting into the States.\\n', \"02:11.360 --> 02:13.440\\n I'm one of the newer team members here.\\n\", \"02:13.440 --> 02:17.840\\n So we're really ramping up here in the North American market.\\n\", \"02:17.840 --> 02:21.920\\n I'd love to, you know, my goal was really just to see if I can coordinate some time\\n\", '02:21.920 --> 02:27.240\\n with either yourself or whoever that, I guess that IT manager would be, just to have a conversation\\n', '02:27.240 --> 02:29.720\\n and see if it makes sense.\\n', \"02:29.720 --> 02:32.880\\n If you have some free time, I'd love to schedule that with you.\\n\", '02:32.880 --> 02:35.880\\n But again, I just wanted it to make sense for you guys, you know.\\n', '02:35.880 --> 02:36.880\\n Yeah.\\n', '02:36.880 --> 02:41.040\\n Let me mention you to my head of digital product.\\n', '02:41.040 --> 02:42.040\\n Okay.\\n', \"02:42.040 --> 02:43.520\\n Because that's where that role would roll up into.\\n\", \"02:43.520 --> 02:45.960\\n And so if there's an interest, I'll have him reach out.\\n\", '02:45.960 --> 02:46.960\\n Deal?\\n', '02:46.960 --> 02:47.960\\n Deal.\\n', \"02:47.960 --> 02:52.520\\n If it's okay for me to just email you my information, maybe you can forward it to that gentleman.\\n\", '02:52.520 --> 02:53.520\\n Sure.\\n', \"02:53.520 --> 02:55.320\\n It's Renee at CaliHealth.\\n\", '02:55.320 --> 02:56.320\\n Okay.\\n', '02:56.320 --> 02:57.320\\n I really appreciate that.\\n', '02:57.320 --> 02:58.320\\n Have a great weekend.\\n', '02:58.320 -->

Okay.\\n\", \"00:47.080 --> 00:53.080\\n Well, I'm happy I got this audio fixed here. Like I mentioned, I am with Aloha Technology.\\n\", '00:53.080 --> 01:00.080\\n We are in the software engineer support space. And I was doing a little bit of research on\\n', '01:00.080 --> 01:06.080\\n authorities here online. I noticed that you guys had a need for some developers, full\\n', '01:06.080 --> 01:11.080\\n stack developers, just back in software support. And I wanted to know if it would be possible\\n', '01:11.080 --> 01:17.080\\n just to learn about if you guys still have a need for that. I just wanted to know if\\n', '01:17.080 --> 01:20.080\\n I can connect with you, maybe talk to you a little bit further about what we do and\\n', \"01:20.080 --> 01:25.080\\n how we can support you in that space. Yeah, no, I understand. And I understand that you're\\n\", \"01:25.080 --> 01:33.080\\n looking at this as a trigger to maybe potential business. And that's fine. We do have outside\\n\", '01:33.080 --> 01:39.080\\n developer or company that help us out in the development. But we are definitely looking\\n', '01:39.080 --> 01:46.080\\n for bringing this inside. Okay. You need to understand the Canadian context here. In Canada,\\n', '01:46.080 --> 01:54.080\\n we are funded or we have availability of funding with the Canadian government with what we\\n', '01:54.080 --> 02:00.080\\n call tax credit. But in order to access those tax credit, the firm needs to be either in\\n', \"02:00.080 --> 02:04.080\\n Canada and that's just a portion of it. Or if it's our own employee, then we get the\\n\", \"02:04.080 --> 02:14.080\\n full credit. And this is significant. So that's why you can compete because even if I compare\\n\", \"02:14.080 --> 02:19.080\\n your rate with the Canadian firm, with the credit that applies to Canadian firm, there's\\n\", '02:19.080 --> 02:26.080\\n no way you can compete if you understand. And the other reason is, for example, if we\\n', \"02:26.080 --> 02:34.080\\n bring it inside, it's even more interesting for us. It's basically for every dollar we\\n\", '02:34.080 --> 02:41.080\\n spend, it costs us 25 cents. Okay, yeah, that totally makes sense because it sounds like\\n', '02:41.080 --> 02:50.080\\n the Canadian government is giving an incentive to hire within and kind of grow that base.\\n', \"02:50.080 --> 02:56.080\\n Well, yeah, it's mostly on the R&D side. It's on the development side. It's not on everything.\\n\", \"02:56.080 --> 03:01.080\\n It's strictly on development of new product and things like that that this applied. And\\n\", \"03:01.080 --> 03:07.080\\n that's why we're looking to... We are using external firm right now, but it's not giving\\n\", \"03:07.080 --> 03:14.080\\n us the advantage if we were having our own internal people. So that's why we're not going\\n\", \"03:14.080 --> 03:20.080\\n to... So I understand you're looking at this as a potential interest. I hear you, but there's\\n\", \"03:20.080 --> 03:26.080\\n no point of continuing because that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for bringing\\n\", \"03:26.080 --> 03:30.080\\n this internally because it's a major saving for us.\\n\", '03:30.080 --> 03:37.080\\n Well, that totally makes sense. And really, I appreciate you giving me that honesty there\\n', \"03:37.080 --> 03:42.080\\n because, again, you've got to put your focus on where your priority is. If you are in the\\n\", '03:42.080 --> 03:51.080\\n market to leverage any talent in the future, essentially what we do is our engineers are\\n', \"03:51.080 --> 03:56.080\\n experiencing where between four to six years, they're 3,500 a month. It comes with the project\\n\", \"03:56.080 --> 04:02.080\\n manager and we're actually offering 30 days upfront with no cost, no commitment, just\\n\", \"04:02.080 --> 04:07.080\\n to provide value to our client partners. That might not be something that's valuable now,\\n\", \"04:07.080 --> 04:13.080\\n but in the future, I think that could be something in the event that it's necessary.\\n\", \"04:13.080 --> 04:20.080\\n Yeah, I understand. And believe me, you're not the only one chasing us. I get probably\\n\", \"04:20.080 --> 04:26.080\\n at least one or two requests a day. So typically, I get them by email, but now I've got a phone\\n\", \"04:26.080 --> 04:32.080\\n call, so you've got an answer or the other one I just don't answer. So you've been lucky.\\n\", \"04:32.080 --> 04:37.080\\n Okay. Well, listen, I appreciate the conversation, but it's always something to learn from.\\n\", '04:37.080 --> 04:42.080\\n Yeah, well, if you were moving to Canada, that would be a different story, but then\\n', \"04:42.080 --> 04:49.080\\n I may entertain you as a potential provider. But in the U.S. right now, it just doesn't\\n\", '04:49.080 --> 04:51.080\\n make any sense for us.\\n', '04:51.080 --> 04:57.080\\n Oh, no worries. To my knowledge, again, our company is based out of – our company is\\n', \"04:57.080 --> 05:02.080\\n headquartered in Singapore, so our talent is based overseas. They're going to be working\\n\", \"05:02.080 --> 05:06.080\\n remotely, so I don't know how that would actually affect you in terms of –\\n\", \"05:06.080 --> 05:17.080\\n That doesn't help us either unless they're really at the low rate, which we are already\\n\", \"05:17.080 --> 05:28.080\\n using some of that overseas talent at a much reduced rate. But there's a formula there\\n\", '05:28.080 --> 05:31.080\\n for us that needs to – that makes it work.\\n', \"05:31.080 --> 05:36.080\\n Well, I totally appreciate that. And again, sometimes it's timing and it has to make\\n\", \"05:36.080 --> 05:40.080\\n sense. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk with you. And in the future, if there's\\n\", \"05:40.080 --> 05:45.080\\n any way we can be a resource to you, we're a phone call away.

So I just wanted to\\n', \"00:29.240 --> 00:32.760\\n reach out to introduce myself and wanted to see, well, number one, I didn't know if you\\n\", \"00:32.760 --> 00:37.160\\n were the right person per se that's hiring for this role, but I did want to talk to you\\n\", '00:37.160 --> 00:38.160\\n about this.\\n', '00:38.160 --> 00:39.160\\n Do you speak Spanish?\\n', \"00:39.160 --> 00:41.160\\n I don't personally. So I'm requesting...\\n\", \"00:41.160 --> 00:53.160\\n We're in a phase in Quebec and we need somebody who talks, who talks, who's bilingual actually.\\n\", '00:53.160 --> 00:58.320\\n Okay. Okay. Well, what I was going to mention to you, sir, is that I work with Aloha Tech\\n', \"00:58.320 --> 01:03.920\\n and essentially what we do is we do engineer placement. So more than likely there's an\\n\", \"01:03.920 --> 01:07.880\\n individual that we can work with you on that has that ability that's bilingual that speaks\\n\", '01:07.880 --> 01:09.880\\n French that also has skills.\\n', \"01:09.880 --> 01:14.120\\n Well, send me an email and I'll take a look at it.\\n\", '01:14.120 --> 01:18.120\\n Okay. So would you like for me to send you a resume or a profile? Would that make more\\n', '01:18.120 --> 01:19.120\\n sense?\\n', '01:19.120 --> 01:22.120\\n A profile of who?\\n', \"01:22.120 --> 01:29.000\\n Well, that's what I was saying. So Aloha Technology, we provide actual engineering\\n\", \"01:29.000 --> 01:34.200\\n professionals. So we're more in the staffing aspect. So I can send you some resumes of\\n\", '01:34.200 --> 01:39.520\\n representatives that meet the requirement to speak French and also the skillset aspect\\n', '01:39.520 --> 01:42.240\\n of the position. So whatever...\\n', '01:42.240 --> 01:45.080\\n You work with people from all over the world or...\\n', '01:45.080 --> 01:49.880\\n Yeah. So Aloha Tech is actually based out of Singapore. We have over a thousand different\\n', '01:49.880 --> 01:52.320\\n engineers. They are multilingual.\\n', '01:52.320 --> 01:54.360\\n I understand.\\n', \"01:54.360 --> 01:59.240\\n We're pretty straightforward in regards to the engineers. Each of them are 3,500 a month.\\n\", \"01:59.240 --> 02:03.640\\n They come with a project manager. And what we're doing is we're actually giving the first\\n\", \"02:03.640 --> 02:09.720\\n month of that engineer that tandem, it's going to be no commitment, just upfront. So we just\\n\", '02:09.720 --> 02:12.520\\n wanted you to be able to take advantage of the engineer.\\n', \"02:12.520 --> 02:20.800\\n Send me an email of your company and I'll take a look at it. But we're looking for somebody\\n\", \"02:20.800 --> 02:23.800\\n who's full-time with us.\\n\", \"02:23.800 --> 02:31.080\\n Yeah. Yeah. That's definitely something we can do. Would pierre.marco at groupcontacts.ca\\n\", '02:31.080 --> 02:32.080\\n be the right email?\\n', '02:32.080 --> 02:33.080\\n Yeah.\\n', \"02:33.080 --> 02:38.600\\n Okay. So what I'll do is I'll send you an email now and we can maybe coordinate... I'm\\n\", \"02:38.600 --> 02:43.680\\n not sure if you're free, but if you're free to connect maybe tomorrow next week, I can\\n\", '02:43.680 --> 02:44.680\\n actually probably have someone...\\n', \"02:44.680 --> 02:48.640\\n Send me the email and I'll process it along the way and see what we can do.\\n\", '02:48.640 --> 02:51.480\\n Okay. Sounds like a plan. Thank you, sir.\\n', '02:51.480 --> 02:52.480\\n Thank you. Bye.\\n', '02:52.480 --> 03:09.280\\n Okay. Have a good one.\\n']",

I appreciate that extra info.\\n', \"02:26.000 --> 02:30.000\\n It's helpful in kind of playing with what we're doing,\\n\", \"02:30.000 --> 02:34.000\\n which is we're building, well, we've built software\\n\", '02:34.000 --> 02:38.000\\n for our specific industry and the private lending industry.\\n', \"02:38.000 --> 02:46.000\\n And so best lending is like the software's kind of flagship client.\\n\", '02:46.000 --> 02:49.000\\n So we have two businesses, the lending company, Best Lending Co.,\\n', '02:49.000 --> 02:53.000\\n and then a software company called Arrow.\\n', '02:53.000 --> 02:57.000\\n And we were actually hiring for Arrow\\n', '02:57.000 --> 03:04.000\\n because we do need full-time people to be fully developing that 24-7.\\n', '03:04.000 --> 03:10.000\\n But we also outsourced some of our development as well overseas\\n', '03:10.000 --> 03:12.000\\n for all the obvious reasons.\\n', '03:12.000 --> 03:22.000\\n And so basically, as we go through more and more scaling and growth cycles,\\n', \"03:22.000 --> 03:24.000\\n we're constantly talking about the difference\\n\", '03:24.000 --> 03:27.000\\n between hiring our next developer in-house\\n', '03:27.000 --> 03:35.000\\n and also doing something more like overseas contract work\\n', '03:35.000 --> 03:38.000\\n or something more like what your company is offering,\\n', '03:38.000 --> 03:40.000\\n which is a little bit different.\\n', '03:40.000 --> 03:43.000\\n More tailored, I guess, or structured.\\n', \"03:43.000 --> 03:47.000\\n Yeah. To be honest with you, Ben, that's kind of the direction.\\n\", \"03:47.000 --> 03:51.000\\n And that's really all the conversations that I have with companies like yours.\\n\", \"03:51.000 --> 03:55.000\\n So I'm talking to SMB all the way to enterprise level.\\n\", \"03:55.000 --> 03:59.000\\n And it's really just looking to try to match in terms of –\\n\", '03:59.000 --> 04:02.000\\n looking to match apples to apples, okay, from a support standpoint.\\n', \"04:02.000 --> 04:04.000\\n Okay, we've got what you need in terms of experience.\\n\", '04:04.000 --> 04:09.000\\n All of our reps are anywhere on average on a minimum four to six years of experience.\\n', \"04:09.000 --> 04:12.000\\n And it's a very straightforward model of how we do things.\\n\", '04:12.000 --> 04:16.000\\n So we get right to the point in terms of just cost and in terms of value.\\n', \"04:16.000 --> 04:20.000\\n Having an internal development team, what I've learned,\\n\", '04:20.000 --> 04:22.000\\n most companies will want to have that.\\n', '04:22.000 --> 04:25.000\\n Just having a U.S.-based team for cultural reasons,\\n', \"04:25.000 --> 04:28.000\\n it's just great to kind of have that, and they can kind of deliver what's necessary.\\n\", '04:28.000 --> 04:35.000\\n And when it comes to just communication aspects, that is a strong suit.\\n', \"04:35.000 --> 04:38.000\\n But where we've really kind of filled in and brought balance is,\\n\", '04:38.000 --> 04:40.000\\n okay, so you have an internal team.\\n', '04:40.000 --> 04:43.000\\n What we look to do is just bring just extra resources,\\n', '04:43.000 --> 04:46.000\\n which is a lot more cost effective mainly.\\n', '04:46.000 --> 04:50.000\\n But even with a cultural standpoint, these guys are multilingual,\\n', \"04:50.000 --> 04:52.000\\n and they're there to really bring value,\\n\", '04:52.000 --> 04:56.000\\n to really kind of help the overall process be a little bit more well-rounded\\n', '04:56.000 --> 04:58.000\\n and save you a lot more money.\\n', \"04:58.000 --> 05:02.000\\n So that's really very straightforward for you.\\n\", '05:02.000 --> 05:03.000\\n Yeah.\\n', '05:03.000 --> 05:06.000\\n No, it definitely sounds like interest.\\n', '05:06.000 --> 05:09.000\\n Yeah, I was going to say I can email you and Adam,\\n', \"05:09.000 --> 05:15.000\\n and if you'd like to, maybe we can schedule a quick 10, 15-minute chat sometime this week.\\n\", '05:15.000 --> 05:19.000\\n And again, just to give you a little more context on how this works.\\n', '05:19.000 --> 05:21.000\\n And whenever you guys are ready to actually pull the trigger,\\n', '05:21.000 --> 05:24.000\\n it may not be for best lending, but for Aero, like you mentioned,\\n', '05:24.000 --> 05:28.000\\n that could be something you guys could really leverage to your benefit now\\n', '05:28.000 --> 05:31.000\\n or just whenever it works for you.\\n', \"05:31.000 --> 05:35.000\\n But I think just cost-wise, for the value of what you're going to get, it's no comparison.\\n\", '05:35.000 --> 05:40.000\\n And I can definitely have some profiles of some of my reps and over to you too.\\n', '05:40.000 --> 05:43.000\\n So just so you can get a look at it and see what that is.\\n', '05:43.000 --> 05:49.000\\n But I think the biggest value that we offer is 30 days up front, no commitment cost-wise, contract.\\n', '05:49.000 --> 05:52.000\\n We just want you to take advantage of the value,\\n', '05:52.000 --> 05:55.000\\n and that we work with you in lockstep moving forward.\\n', \"05:55.000 --> 05:57.000\\n That's how we like to approach things.\\n\", \"05:57.000 --> 06:05.000\\n So I'd love to know, I don't know if you and or Adam would have maybe a 15, 30-minute window sometime this week.\\n\", '06:05.000 --> 06:07.000\\n Maybe we can connect.\\n', '06:07.000 --> 06:09.000\\n And I can definitely email you guys either way.\\n', '06:09.000 --> 06:14.000\\n I think the emails I have for you and Adam are Ben and Adam at bestlendingco.\\n', '06:14.000 --> 06:17.000\\n Is there a better email I can catch you guys on?\\n', \"06:17.000 --> 06:21.000\\n Yeah, why don't you email us on the Aero account?\\n\", '06:21.000 --> 06:28.000\\n Okay.\\n', '06:28.000 --> 06:33.000\\n So myaero.app.\\n', '06:33.000 --> 06:35.000\\n A-P-P.\\n', '06:35.000 --> 06:36.000\\n A-P-P, okay.\\n', '06:36.000 --> 06:41.000\\n So B-E-N at myaero, A-E-R-O, like AeroPostle, dot app.\\n', \"06:41.000 --> 06:43.000\\n Yep, that's it.\\n\", '06:43.000 --> 06:44.000\\n Okay.\\n', \"06:44.000 --> 06:45.000\\n I'll email you.\\n\", '06:45.000 --> 06:48.000\\n I can definitely send you an email if you want to forward it over to Adam.\\n', \"06:48.000 --> 06:49.000\\n That's great.\\n\", '06:49.000 --> 06:51.000\\n I can send you the same email.\\n', '06:51.000 --> 06:53.000\\n I can copy them too, just in terms of like mailing them email.\\n', '06:53.000 --> 06:54.000\\n Yep, same thing.\\n', '06:54.000 --> 06:55.000\\n You can just do Adam.\\n', '06:55.000 --> 06:56.000\\n Okay.\\n', '06:56.000 --> 06:57.000\\n Just do Adam at.\\n', \"06:57.000 --> 06:58.000\\n So I'll do that.\\n\", \"06:58.000 --> 07:05.000\\n And I mean, if you have some time this week, how's your availability looking just to connect for a few minutes?\\n\", '07:05.000 --> 07:14.000\\n So what I was going to say is if you include all that info along with some kind of basic pricing tiers or however the pricing works, I think that would be good.\\n', \"07:14.000 --> 07:15.000\\n Oh, yeah, that's all there.\\n\", '07:15.000 --> 07:19.000\\n So we have a really busy next week.\\n', \"07:19.000 --> 07:23.000\\n I'm traveling at the end of next week and I'll be gone for seven days afterwards.\\n\", '07:23.000 --> 07:29.000\\n And we are finishing up some refactoring of code right now on the back end.\\n', '07:29.000 --> 07:30.000\\n Okay.\\n', '07:30.000 --> 07:35.000\\n And we have our team kind of focused on that right now and kind of with their heads are down working on that.\\n', \"07:35.000 --> 07:48.000\\n So we've kind of set up hiring help just actually twice recently, once today, someone else applied and once like two weeks ago, just to kind of gauge when the dev team is really going to need the help.\\n\", \"07:48.000 --> 07:53.000\\n And they've actually kind of pushed it off until we're done with this transition right now.\\n\", \"07:53.000 --> 07:58.000\\n So that's time to link would be after September 8.\\n\", '07:58.000 --> 08:00.000\\n By the looks of it.\\n', '08:00.000 --> 08:04.000\\n Okay, I can always put that in the calendar.\\n', \"08:04.000 --> 08:11.000\\n Yeah, yeah. Well, why don't you email over and then maybe we can schedule something for I think September 8 is like a Thursday.\\n\", '08:11.000 --> 08:15.000\\n So maybe that following Monday or Tuesday, the 12th or 13th.\\n', '08:15.000 --> 08:22.000\\n I mean, I mean, if this time is maybe a little earlier in the afternoon.\\n', '08:22.000 --> 08:27.000\\n I mean, whatever time you feel is probably open for you, I can definitely shoot you a Monday or Tuesday calendar invite.\\n', '08:27.000 --> 08:30.000\\n And, you know, as we get closer to the time, we can always adjust it.\\n', \"08:30.000 --> 08:34.000\\n I just wanted to I just wanted to put it on on the books so I won't forget it.\\n\", \"08:34.000 --> 08:39.000\\n You know, I can definitely I'll shoot you and Adam with information so you guys have it.\\n\", \"08:39.000 --> 08:44.000\\n It's on hand and, you know, we can connect, you know, in a couple of weeks.\\n\", '08:44.000 --> 08:46.000\\n Is that okay?\\n', '08:46.000 --> 08:48.000\\n Yeah, that sounds perfect.
